## Overview
The attempt of this project is to analyze comments gathered from reddit.  The comments are seperated by subreddit categories.  
I will choose subreddits that have different political biases and will see if any difference in comments can be used to create 
an algorithm capable of classfying future comments into the correct subreddit category.
