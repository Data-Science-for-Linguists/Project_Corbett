You seem to hate Android and worship Apple.\n\nCurved screen - Right, something that changes the phone to be completely screen (almost), and curves so that you get a more immersive experience is just child's play! Let's remove the headphone jack! That's real innovation!\n\nHeart rate sensor- just as much innovation as 3D touch. Just cause you don't use it, doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nBixby- ah yes! Another r/Android user who has watched one video about Bixby and decided it's inferior to Satan himself! Good to know you're educated on the subject! /s\n\n\nThe S8 camera is just as viable in the \"pick up and snap\" category as the iPhone 7 is. The S8 is FAR superior if you venture into Pro mode. Cause you know, not all consumers are little kids. Some people want to try to take to good pictures...\n\nTouchID - Obviously.\n\n3D Touch - A gimmick tbh. It doesn't change the user experience in any meaningful way. It's a toy to show off to others. Plus Android can replicate it through software and it's just as useful. It's not really innovation. But ir can have an impact on UX so if you want to call it that, I guess.\n\nCamera improvements - So basically what everyone does every year, is innovation? Samsung improved the software on the S8 while keeping the S7 sensor. The S8 shoots better pics than the S7. That's not innovation. That's an expected upgrade.\n\n\n\"Dual Camera System that Actually works\" I am pretty sure Huawei would laugh at that claim.\n\n\nApple Pay - Really? Being a popular company means you can claim innovation on something you did second? Okay. Cool. /s\n\nI take it you haven't used an S8... It's like you don't understand how much better this device is to use. Like, it's a religion. Once you go infinity display, you never go back.\n\nAndroid OS - Biggest flaw? Bitch please! This is the most useless statement of ever. It's the biggest advantage. It might be the biggest flaw to you. But again, your bias has no impact on the reality of the product. The reality is that Android devices are successful because Android has done some amazing things. \n\nLet's just be done with this.
