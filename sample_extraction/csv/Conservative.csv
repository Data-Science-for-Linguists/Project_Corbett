You admit, though, that you don't have the answer.

But you want the wall. To keep immigrants out.

This begs the question: Why do you want to keep immigrants out if we obviously have a need for them here in this country? Why not simply make it easier for them to become citizens? If you're a fiscal conservative (are you?), you're missing very basic math.

Tons of squandered crops = bad

Spending tons of taxpayer $$ on a wall = bad (if you believe in less spending, of course)

Let immigrants in, make them citizens, and we need no wall, so we save $$, plus crops get picked, plus tax dollars from labor = good. 

The only arguments for not allowing immigrants in are generally couched in racism or ignorance. If the economic arguments don't make sense, how can fiscal conservatives still support a border wall?
