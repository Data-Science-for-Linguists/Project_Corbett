He didn't expect to be president, he doesn't know how to be president, and he doesn't care about being president outside of it's ability to make everyone focus on him and drive his own ego. It's exactly what it looks like. It always has been."		0.0	dkzncrp	t1_dkzhzuw	1503654253.0	5.0	False

3	whoismikejoneswho			Not sure but I highly doubt that there are any other more salacious news organizations spewing inciteful messages from within Israel's own borders. Because the Al Jazeera name carries with it a gravitas of legitimacy, which it has earned through credible reporting elsewhere, it is perceived to be a generally credible source. Reality is, Al Jazeera is great on 95% and rabid on the Israel - Palestine question. I understand your point of people deciding what they want to hear and going somewhere else for it - but let that somewhere else be a known Hamas mouthpiece rather than from an otherwise respected source where people believe its credible info. 		0.0	dkzncyc	t1_dkzmpxs	1503654256.0	2.0	False

If the only options are unthinkable, why not take the unthinkable option that doesn't kill hundreds of thousands--perhaps millions--and just leave them the fuck alone.  Make it perfectly clear that we will never attack them for any reason other than defense--instead of posturing that we're about to start dropping bombs.  

They have nukes now, get over it.  We've gotten use to Pakistan and India having nukes, just leave DPRK the fuck alone."		0.0	dkzndq2	t1_dkzavpe	1503654267.0	1.0	False
