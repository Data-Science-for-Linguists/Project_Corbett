They are still worried about the Trump voters in their districts and backlash from the party leaders - a huge problem with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell leading Congress.  

They have to toe the company line as much as possible, but they're not all complete idiots.  They know what type of person Trump is and there was a reason none of them had any interest in supporting him in the first place.  Whether Jeff Flake is truly concerned or not, its important to realize that Republicans in the Senate and House are taking a firm anti-Trump stance.  There will be more over time since the White House craziness isn't going away anytime soon, and eventually/hopefully it will reach a tipping point to get him and those complicit with him out of the White House."		0.0	dkznccs	t1_dkzi6hl	1503654248.0	1.0	False
