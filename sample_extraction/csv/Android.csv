0	T_GTX	userBlack	Le Pro3 + Moto E	I think it's referring to stock Android. Some OEMs already include this feature, I think even my LG Flex 2 had it.  		0.0	dkznd2b	t1_dkzn9gx	1503654257.0	2.0	False

Curved screen - Right, something that changes the phone to be completely screen (almost), and curves so that you get a more immersive experience is just child's play! Let's remove the headphone jack! That's real innovation!

Heart rate sensor- just as much innovation as 3D touch. Just cause you don't use it, doesn't mean it's useless.

Bixby- ah yes! Another r/Android user who has watched one video about Bixby and decided it's inferior to Satan himself! Good to know you're educated on the subject! /s


The S8 camera is just as viable in the ""pick up and snap"" category as the iPhone 7 is. The S8 is FAR superior if you venture into Pro mode. Cause you know, not all consumers are little kids. Some people want to try to take to good pictures...

TouchID - Obviously.

3D Touch - A gimmick tbh. It doesn't change the user experience in any meaningful way. It's a toy to show off to others. Plus Android can replicate it through software and it's just as useful. It's not really innovation. But ir can have an impact on UX so if you want to call it that, I guess.

Camera improvements - So basically what everyone does every year, is innovation? Samsung improved the software on the S8 while keeping the S7 sensor. The S8 shoots better pics than the S7. That's not innovation. That's an expected upgrade.


""Dual Camera System that Actually works"" I am pretty sure Huawei would laugh at that claim.


Apple Pay - Really? Being a popular company means you can claim innovation on something you did second? Okay. Cool. /s

I take it you haven't used an S8... It's like you don't understand how much better this device is to use. Like, it's a religion. Once you go infinity display, you never go back.

Android OS - Biggest flaw? Bitch please! This is the most useless statement of ever. It's the biggest advantage. It might be the biggest flaw to you. But again, your bias has no impact on the reality of the product. The reality is that Android devices are successful because Android has done some amazing things. 

Let's just be done with this. Not getting anything done by spewing bias at each other."		0.0	dkzndn5	t1_dkzm229	1503654266.0	0.0	False
