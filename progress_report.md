### Progress Report Reddit Comment Classification

10/12/2017
	- downloaded one year worth of reddit data to begin with
	- created a list of subreddit threads (almost 10,000 threads)
	- wrote a program to iterate through all posts and extract and save to file the posts from designted subreddits
	- created a small sample data (2000 entries) set to demonstrate extraction
	- since the program takes several hours to run, I will run program over night for the next week or so
	- files are saved preserving the json format of the data

10/02/2017
	- began downloading JSON files (files are large so it may take time to download and extract)
	- began loading files into python and studying format
	- wrote a script that can look for instances of strings in the JSON objects
