Maybe hang the possibility of withdrawing US forces from South Korea after reunification.\n\nI mean China, if its intelligence community is at least a bit competent (we don't know it, but let's bet that it is), would most probably already have a lot more plans on how to make reunification happen than the US does. They would have a lot more intelligence on North Korea, would be in contact with the other higher-ups in the country's political and military elite who could possibly stage a coup. The biggest reason for North Korea's existence supported by China is to be a buffer state against U.S. forces, and the biggest reason for U.S. forces existence in South Korea is due to the threat of North Korean invasion. If America can trust China enough to do a tit-for-tat, the North Korean problem could be solved without any nukes dropping anywhere. But it's really up to China, and South Korea getting on board with such a proposal.\n\nThe thing is, this solution makes a lot of sense to me but would probably be so unpalatable to Washington war hawks who want bases everywhere on Earth that it wouldn't happen.", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1501545628, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dkznd1c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6qcqv0", "parent_id": "t1_dkwhldl", "retrieved_on": 1503654257, "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "geopolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnn"}
