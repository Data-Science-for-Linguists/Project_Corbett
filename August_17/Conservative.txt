To keep immigrants out.\n\nThis begs the question: Why do you want to keep immigrants out if we obviously have a need for them here in this country? Why not simply make it easier for them to become citizens? If you're a fiscal conservative (are you?), you're missing very basic math.\n\nTons of squandered crops = bad\n\nSpending tons of taxpayer $$ on a wall = bad (if you believe in less spending, of course)\n\nLet immigrants in, make them citizens, and we need no wall, so we save $$, plus crops get picked, plus tax dollars from labor = good. \n\nThe only arguments for not allowing immigrants in are generally couched in racism or ignorance. If the economic arguments don't make sense, how can fiscal conservatives still support a border wall?\n\n", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1501545612, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dkzncm2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6po0st", "parent_id": "t1_dkzj16i", "retrieved_on": 1503654251, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Conservative", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p"}
