Many people were rationalizing it would pay off with the album, but instead we got the most heavily marketed AF album with the worst content. I liked the tracks everything now, electric blue, put your money on me, and we don't deserve love, and think they would make an excellent 4 track EP, however the rest of the songs honestly hurt to listen too, knowing this is the same band that made 4 fantastic albums.
