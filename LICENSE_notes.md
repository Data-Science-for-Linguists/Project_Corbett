### LICENSE_notes Reddit Comment Classification

I found the information I was looking at https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement/

The agreement states that "You may not otherwise make unauthorized commercial use of, reproduce, prepare derivative works, 
distribute copies, perform, or publicly display reddit content, except as permitted by the doctrine of fair use or as authorized in writing by us."

Since I am using the data for educational purposes, I believe that I am able to use it and provide the data along with my project.

I included LICENSE.md that states this and also includes information allowing others to use the data as long as the also abide by the fair use doctrine.

I also stated in LICENSE.md, that anyone may use any part of my code as long as credit is given to me.

One concern is the possibility that one of the posts contains copyrighted material.

I believe that since my work with the data is transformative, I should be able to also use and include this data as well.
